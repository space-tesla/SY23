Model the following Automobile information system as a graph model,and
answer the following queries using Cypher.
Consider an Automobile industry manufacturing different types of vehicles
like Two- Wheeler, Four-Wheeler, etc. A customer can buyone or more types
of vehicle. A person can recommend or rate a vehicletype.
1. Identify the labels and relationships, along with their properties, and
draw a high-level Graph model. [3]
2. Create nodes and relationships, along with their properties, and
visualize your actual Graph model. [3]
3. Answer the following Queries:
a. List the characteristics of four wheeler types. [3]
b. List the name of customers who bought a two wheeler vehicle. [3]
c. List the customers who bought more than one type of vehicle. [4]
d. List the most recommended vehicle type. [4]

# Step 1: Open MongoDB    using mongosh
mongosh

# Step 2: Create a database for the automobile information system
use automobile_information_db

# Step 3: Create collections for vehicles, customers, and ratings
db.vehicles.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, type: "Two-Wheeler", characteristics: ["Lightweight", "Fuel Efficient", "Compact"], model: "Yamaha FZ", recommended: true },
  { _id: 2, type: "Four-Wheeler", characteristics: ["Spacious", "Fuel Efficient", "High Speed"], model: "Toyota Corolla", recommended: true },
  { _id: 3, type: "Two-Wheeler", characteristics: ["Affordable", "Fuel Efficient"], model: "Honda Activa", recommended: false },
  { _id: 4, type: "Four-Wheeler", characteristics: ["Luxury", "High Speed", "Spacious"], model: "BMW 5 Series", recommended: true },
  { _id: 5, type: "Two-Wheeler", characteristics: ["Affordable", "Compact"], model: "Suzuki Access", recommended: true }
])

db.customers.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, name: "John Doe", purchased_vehicles: [1, 2] },
  { _id: 2, name: "Jane Smith", purchased_vehicles: [3] },
  { _id: 3, name: "Alex Johnson", purchased_vehicles: [4, 5] },
  { _id: 4, name: "Emily Davis", purchased_vehicles: [1] }
])

# Step 4: Write the Cypher queries to fetch the required results

# a. List the characteristics of four-wheeler types
db.vehicles.aggregate([
  { $match: { type: "Four-Wheeler" } },
  { $project: { model: 1, characteristics: 1 } }
])

# b. List the names of customers who bought a two-wheeler vehicle
db.customers.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$purchased_vehicles" },
  { $lookup: {
      from: "vehicles",
      localField: "purchased_vehicles",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "vehicle_details"
  }},
  { $match: { "vehicle_details.type": "Two-Wheeler" } },
  { $project: { name: 1 } }
])

# c. List the customers who bought more than one type of vehicle
db.customers.aggregate([
  { $match: { "purchased_vehicles": { $size: { $gt: 1 } } } },
  { $project: { name: 1 } }
])

# d. List the most recommended vehicle type
db.vehicles.aggregate([
  { $match: { recommended: true } },
  { $group: { _id: "$type", count: { $sum: 1 } } },
  { $sort: { count: -1 } },
  { $limit: 1 }
])

# Step 5: Exit MongoDB   
exit
